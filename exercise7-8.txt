the sport table satisfies 2NF. This is a simple example because the table 
has only one non-key column and only one candidate key as stated in the reading
major table only has one colum so it cannot be 2nf
student_major is not either because it has emails assigned to multiple majors
because some students are dual majors
student_sport is in the 2NF because based of the email and sport you will 
learn the gender of the sport and student
